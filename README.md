####Description of the game


**Hangman** is a fun version of the well-known, homonymous paper and pencil guessing game. As a player you will be given a random category and word, but only the category will be shown. The goal is to guess the word within a predetermined amount of attempts, by chosing letters from the alphabet. Each time you guess a letter that is not contained in the word, a body part of the hangman will be drawn to the screen. If you guess the word within your given attempts you win the game, otherwise the hangman will be drawn completely and you lose.  


####Which technologies did I use? 


1. **HTML** 				- for the basic structure of the game
2. **CSS**				- for the visual aspect of the game
3. **Javascript**		- adding functionality to the game
4. **jQuery**				- simplifying DOM manipulation 


#### Design Approach


I started out drawing a very basic design on a table (whiteboarding). Once I had a clearer idea of what I wanted the game to look like, I made more precise wireframes with [**balsamiq**](https://github.com/davenhauser/Hangman/blob/master/assets/wireframes/Wireframes_Balsamiq.pdf). I knew for sure I wanted to have a board with all of the letters of the ABC showing next to the hangman, apart from an attampts and catefory field. Having done that, I finished my design with **HTML**, **JAVASCRIPT** and specially **CSS**, adding more detail to the design. In regards of the background image I had no preference, which is why I tried different options and decided to go with the one that in my opinion looked best. 

#### What do I need to do to play the game?

Just follow this [link](http://davenhauser.github.io/Hangman/) and you're ready to play!

#### Planned features and unsolved problems

There are a couple of features that I wish to further develop or implement. They can be found under the follwing [Trello Link for my Hangman Game.](https://trello.com/b/j6nbSLfb/project-1-hangman). You will aslo find my user stories there!
I specially want to work on the positioning of my elements and make the game adaptable to different screen sizes.
